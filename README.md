## Getting Started
Hello, World! And welcome to my personal website! I'm building this while learning next.js and tailwind. I know that using a framework is a bit overkill for what I'm looking to accomplish, but I figured it's something that I can keep building upon as I learn and experiment with new features.

### Tech Stack
* **Primary Language**: TypeScript
* **Framework**: Next.JS 13
* **UI Framework**: React 
* **Backend**: Firebase
* **Styles**: Tailwind.css
* **Mockup**: Figma
* **Development Environment**: Windows 11/ WSL2/ VSCode (vim keybinds)

### Current Features Planned
* Blog with post repository stored in firebase
* Interactive Resume/About section
* Projects showcase 
* Dynamic layout optimized for mobile
* Integration with podcast 
* Mailing list sign-up
