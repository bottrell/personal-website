## Getting Started
Hello, World! And welcome to my personal website! I'm building this while learning next.js and tailwind. I know that using a framework is a bit overkill for what I'm looking to accomplish, but I figured it's something that I can keep building upon as I learn and experiment with new features.

### Tech Stack
* TypeScript
* Next.JS 13
* Firebase
* Tailwind.css


Right now my current objectives are:
* Blog with post repository stored in firebase
* Interactive Resume/About section
* Projects showcase 
* Dynamic layout optimized for mobile
* Integration with podcast 
* Mailing list sign-up
